Why an Ontology for Nuclear Forensics?
--------------------------------------
Nuclear Forensics (NF) as a scientific discipline deals with the identification of nuclear and radiological materials used in illegal activities, determine the source/point-of-origin and routes of transit involving this material, and ultimately contribute to the prosecution of those responsible.  

The field of NF is vast and complex, and the execution of NF activities requires highly trained professionals with access to different tools and information resources.  The goal of developing an ontology for NF is to identify different components and their relationships in NF, capture the essential knowledge and technology apsects in a NF analysis lifecycle, in order to promote common understanding of NF activities, efficient and effective information sharing among different NF related stakeholders, and enable the potential automation of NF processes through big data analytics and machine learning techniques.
